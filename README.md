Chatterbox-VC-MTL is a pipeline designed for voice conversion (VC tab) and voice generation from text.

Both built-in and uploaded voices can be used as reference voices. You can also preview the reference voice before generation or conversion.

During voice conversion, you can change the pitch of the output audio.

When generating from Russian text, you can use a model for stress placement, or specify stress manually (preceding the stressed vowel with a plus sign or using stressed characters: а́, е́, ё́, и́, о́, у́, ы́, э́, ю́, я́).

In addition to the generation parameters, you can select post-processing parameters — removing non-voice sections at the end, middle, and throughout the generated voice, as well as selecting a speed change factor. 
Post-processing can also be run separately from generation.

To simplify the selection of generation parameters, several presets are available.
